# Cosmetic Product Notification

This platform serves as a unified portal where companies can register cosmetic products for the British market, while simultaneously enabling authorised government bodies to access vital product safety information. By facilitating seamless communication between industry and regulators, this system enhances consumer protection across Great Britain through the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS).

Built by the [Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-product-safety-and-standards).
