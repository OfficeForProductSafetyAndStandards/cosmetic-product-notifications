# BEIS - Market Surveillance & Product Safety Digital Service

## Getting Setup
Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/

Install docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Copy the file in the root of the directory called `.env-template`. Rename the copy of the file to `.env` and fill in any environment variables.
This `.env` file will be git ignored, so it is safe to add sensitive data.

Build and start-up the project:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Then in a different terminal initialise the DB
```
docker-compose run web rake db:create
# Run the migrations
docker-compose run web rake db:migrate
# Add an admin user
docker-compose run -e ADMIN_EMAIL=XXX -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=XXX web rails db:seed
```
Visit the site on localhost:3000

### Windows Subsystem for Linux
You will have to install the docker server on Windows, and the docker client on WSL

To make this work, make the current path look like a windows path to appease Windows Docker
```
sudo ln -s /mnt/c /c
cd /c/path/to/project
```

## Tests
You can run the tests with the following command:
```
docker-compose run web rails test
```

You can run the linting with:
```
docker-compose run web rubocop
```

Running this with the --auto-correct flag set will cause rubocop to attempt to fix as many of the issues as it can.

## Styles
This project is following the GOV UK style guides. We have used the GOV UK elements library to define CSS classes. The design guide for this is here: http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/.
