## Getting Setup

This project includes [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules), so when running `git clone` you need to add the `--recurse-submodules` option.
If you have already pulled, you can run `git submodule init` and then `git submodule update --recursive` instead. 
You might also need to run `git submodule update --recursive` if the submodule is updated because of a pull.

Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/.

Increase the memory available to Docker to at least 4GB (instructions for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced)).

Copy the file in the root of the directory called `.env-template`.
Rename the copy of the file to `.env` and fill in any environment variables.
This `.env` file will be git ignored, so it is safe to add sensitive data.
See the [accounts section](#accounts) below for information on how to obtain some of the optional variables.

Add the following entry for Keycloak to your hosts file ([instructions](https://support.rackspace.com/how-to/modify-your-hosts-file/)):

    127.0.0.1   keycloak

Build and start-up the full project:

    docker-compose up

Alternatively, you can run the specific component you're interested in using e.g. `docker-compose up psd-web` or `docker-compose up cosmetics-web`.

You'll then most likely want to run the [Cosmetics setup steps](cosmetics-web/README.md#getting-setup) or [PSD setup steps](psd-web/README.md#getting-setup).

When pulling new changes from master, it is sometimes necessary to run the following
if there are changes to the Docker config:

    docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up


### Design system
Projects in this repository use the [GOV.UK design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk). 
To aid it, the shared-web gem provides an implementation of some of the components - see 
the [README](shared-web/README.md#design-system-components) for more details. 

### Mac tips

[Docker shared volume performance is poor on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/) which can significantly affect e.g. asset compilation.
You can use docker-sync to speed up runtime:

    gem install docker-sync
    docker-sync-stack start


### Windows Subsystem for Linux

You will have to install the docker server on Windows, and the docker client on WSL.

To make this work, make the current path look like a Windows path to appease Docker for Windows:

    sudo ln -s /mnt/c /c
    cd /c/path/to/project

(from https://medium.com/software-development-stories/developing-a-dockerized-web-app-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-61efec965080)
If the web container complains it can find files in the `/app` folder (e.g. `bin/bundle`), that might be sign you're in
the wrong directory.

You may also want to setup docker-sync using [these instructions](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/wiki/docker-sync-on-Windows).


### Accounts

#### Keycloak

The local developer instance of Keycloak is configured with the following default user accounts:
* PSD website: `user@example.com` / `password`
* Admin Console: `admin` / `admin`

Log in to the [Keycloak admin console](http://keycloak:8080/auth/admin) to add or edit users.

Ask someone on the team to create an account for you on the Int and Staging environments.

#### GOV.UK Notify

If you want to send emails from your development instance, or update any API keys for the deployed instances,
you'll need an account for [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk)
- ask someone on the team to invite you.


#### GOV.UK Platform as a Service

If you want to update any of the deployed instances, you'll need an account for
[GOV.UK PaaS](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) - ask someone on the team to invite you.


#### Amazon Web Services

We're using AWS to supplement the functionality of GOV.UK PaaS.
If you want to update any of the deployed instances, you'll need an account - ask someone on the team to invite you.
If you get an error saying you don't have permission to set something, make sure you have MFA set up. 


## Deployment

Anything which is merged to `master` (via a Pull Request or push) will trigger the
[Travis CI build](https://travis-ci.org/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss)
and cause deployments of the various components to the int space on GOV.UK PaaS.

Deployment to research environment does not currently happen automatically, for details see section "Research" in 
[prototypes](https://regulatorydelivery.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PSD/pages/452689949/Prototypes)

Anything merged into the branch `staging` (only via a Pull Request) will cause Travis CI to instead build to the staging
space.
Please only do this if you are confident that this is a stable commit.

Anything merged into the branch `prod` (only via a Pull Request) will cause Travis CI to instead build to the prod
space.
Please only do this if you are confident that this is a stable commit.

### Deployment from scratch

Once you have a GOV.UK PaaS account as mentioned above, you should install the Cloud Foundry CLI (`cf`) from
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads and then run the following commands:

    cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk -u XXX -p XXX
    cf target -o beis-opss

This will log you in and set the correct target organisation.
The login command without -u -p options will not work in some terminals, in particular git-bash. Passing username and
password in one line will. 

If you need to create a new environment, you can run `cf create-space SPACE-NAME`, otherwise, select the correct space using `cf target -o beis-opss -s SPACE-NAME`.
