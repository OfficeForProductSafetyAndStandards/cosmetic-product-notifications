## Getting set up

### Quick start with Docker Compose

Add required hosts in `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1       search_cosmetics
127.0.0.1       submit_cosmetics
```

Run Docker Compose:

`docker-compose up`

Go to app on [submit_cosmetics:3000](http://submit_cosmetics:3000)

### Working with Docker Compose

To start the application, run:

```
docker-compose up cosmetics-web
```

To run a typical Rails command eg. migration, run:

```
docker-compose run cosmetics-web rake db:migrate
```

or tests:

```
docker-compose run cosmetics-web rspec spec/some_specs
```

### Long read with Docker Compose

Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/.

Increase the memory available to Docker to at least 4GB (instructions for [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced)).

See the [accounts section](#accounts) below for information on how to obtain some of the optional variables.

Add required hosts in `/etc/hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1       search_cosmetics
127.0.0.1       submit_cosmetics
```

Build and start-up the full project:

    docker-compose up

Alternatively, you can run the specific component you're interested in using e.g. `docker-compose up cosmetics-web`.

You'll then most likely want to run the [Cosmetics setup steps](cosmetics-web/README.md#getting-setup).

When pulling new changes from `master`, it is sometimes necessary to run the following
if there are changes to the Docker config:

    docker-compose down && docker-compose build && docker-compose up

Initialise the database:

    DISABLE_LOCAL_AUTOINDEX=true docker-compose run cosmetics-web bin/rake db:create db:schema:load

Restart the website (which may have crashed):

    docker-compose restart cosmetics-web

Visit the site on [submit_cosmetics:3000](http://submit_cosmetics:3000)

When pulling new changes from `master`, it is sometimes necessary to run the following
if there are new migrations:

    docker-compose exec cosmetics-web bin/rake db:migrate

### Running without Docker

Running without Docker is often more convenient for development. It is still advised to run all dependencies with Docker Compose:

`docker-compose up db redis opensearch`

Copy config files:

`cp cosmetics-web/.env.development.example cosmetics-web/.env.development`
`cp cosmetics-web/.env.test.example cosmetics-web/.env.test`

And run all steps required to set up the Rails app like bundle install, migrations etc.

### Copying the staging database to your local database

The staging database contains a large amount of redacted data which can be useful when debugging issues or ensuring new
features work properly with old and new data.

To copy the staging database to your local database, run:

    cf conduit cosmetics-database -- pg_dump --file staging_db.sql --no-acl --no-owner --clean
    docker compose cp staging_db.sql db:/tmp
    docker compose exec db psql -f /tmp/staging_db.sql -h localhost -d cosmetics_dev -U postgres

This will download a dump of the staging database, copy it into the correct Docker container and import it into your local
database. Note that all current data in your database will be deleted.

Since encryption secrets differ in each environment, after copying the staging database, you will need to reset the password
and 2FA secret for each account you want to log in with. For example, to do this for a search user, run:

    u = SearchUser.where(email: "email@example.com").first
    u.account_security_completed = nil
    u.encrypted_totp_secret_key = nil
    u.save!

The next time you log in with this user, you will be prompted to choose a password and set up 2FA.

To run these commands, you will need access to [GOV.UK PaaS](#accounts). You will also need to install the `conduit` plugin
for the Cloud Foundry CLI before running for the first time. To do this, run `cf install-plugin conduit`.

### Mac tips

[Docker shared volume performance is poor on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/) which can significantly
affect e.g. asset compilation.

You can use docker-sync to speed up runtime:

    gem install docker-sync
    docker-sync-stack start

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

You will have to install the Docker server on Windows, and the Docker client on WSL.

To make this work, make the current path look like a Windows path to appease Docker for Windows:

    sudo ln -s /mnt/c /c
    cd /c/path/to/project

(from https://medium.com/software-development-stories/developing-a-dockerized-web-app-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-61efec965080)

If the web container complains it can find files in the `/app` folder (e.g. `bin/bundle`), that might be sign you're in
the wrong directory.

You may also want to setup docker-sync using [these instructions](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/wiki/docker-sync-on-Windows).

### Accounts

#### GOV.UK Notify

If you want to send emails from your development instance, or update any API keys for the deployed instances,
you'll need an account for [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk)
- ask someone on the team to invite you.

#### GOV.UK Platform as a Service

If you want to update any of the deployed instances, you'll need an account for
[GOV.UK PaaS](https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk/) - ask someone on the team to invite you.

#### Amazon Web Services

We're using AWS to supplement the functionality of GOV.UK PaaS.
If you want to update any of the deployed instances, you'll need an account - ask someone on the team to invite you.
If you get an error saying you don't have permission to set something, make sure you have MFA set up.

## Security notes

### Active Storage (for rails 6.1.3.1)
IMPORTANT: this should be reviewed on each rails upgrade.

Cosmetics is using ActiveStorage for attachments. By default, Active Storage is using
non-protected urls. Due to confidentiality of our data, we implemented our own version
of ActiveStorage controllers. Routes available from Active Storage:

```
/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/:signed_id/*filename(.:format)                                 active_storage/blobs/redirect#show
/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/:signed_id/*filename(.:format)                                    active_storage/blobs/proxy#show
/rails/active_storage/blobs/:signed_id/*filename(.:format)                                          active_storage/blobs/redirect#show
/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename(.:format)   active_storage/representations/redirect#show
/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename(.:format)      active_storage/representations/proxy#show
/rails/active_storage/representations/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename(.:format)            active_storage/representations/redirect#show
/rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_key/*filename(.:format)                                         active_storage/disk#show
/rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_token(.:format)                                                 active_storage/disk#update
/rails/active_storage/direct_uploads(.:format)                                                      active_storage/direct_uploads#create
```

In Cosmetics, only routes which are being used are:

```
/rails/active_storage/blobs/proxy/:signed_id/*filename(.:format)                                    active_storage/blobs/proxy#show
/rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_key/*filename(.:format)                                         active_storage/disk#show
/rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_token(.:format)                                                 active_storage/disk#update
/rails/active_storage/direct_uploads(.:format)                                                      active_storage/direct_uploads#create
/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename(.:format)      active_storage/representations/proxy#show
```

`active_storage/blobs/proxy#show` has added protection - only owners and search users can access files.

And those routes are explicitly disabled in application:

```
/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/:signed_id/*filename(.:format)                                 active_storage/blobs/redirect#show
/rails/active_storage/blobs/:signed_id/*filename(.:format)                                          active_storage/blobs/redirect#show
/rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename(.:format)   active_storage/representations/redirect#show
/rails/active_storage/representations/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename(.:format)            active_storage/representations/redirect#show
```

## Deployment

Anything which is merged to `master` (via a Pull Request or push) will trigger the
[Github Action Build](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-cosmetics/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
and cause deployments of the various components to the int space on GOV.UK PaaS.

### Deployment from scratch

Once you have a GOV.UK PaaS account as mentioned above, you should install the Cloud Foundry CLI (`cf`) from
https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli#downloads and then run the following commands:

    cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk -u XXX -p XXX
    cf target -o beis-opss

This will log you in and set the correct target organisation.
The login command without -u -p options will not work in some terminals, in particular git-bash. Passing username and
password in one line will.

If you need to create a new environment, you can run `cf create-space SPACE-NAME`, otherwise, select the correct space using `cf target -o beis-opss -s SPACE-NAME`.

The staging Cosmetics website is hosted [here](https://cosmetics-staging.london.cloudapps.digital/).

The production Cosmetics website is hosted [here](https://cosmetics-prod.london.cloudapps.digital/).

### Database

To create a database for the current space:

    cf marketplace -s postgres
    cf enable-service-access postgres
    cf create-service postgres small-13 cosmetics-database

### Opensearch

To create an Opensearch instance for the current space:

    cf marketplace -s opensearch
    cf create-service opensearch tiny-1 cosmetics-opensearch-1

### Redis

To create a Redis instance for the current space.

    cf marketplace -s redis
    cf create-service redis tiny-3.2 cosmetics-queue

The current worker (Sidekiq), which uses `cosmetics-queue` only works with an unclustered instance of Redis.

### S3

When setting up a new environment, you'll also need to create an AWS user called `cosmetics-<<SPACE>>` and keep a note of the Access key ID and secret access key.
Create a policy for this user similar to the [Policy for Programmatic Access from the AWS docs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/writing-iam-policies-how-to-grant-access-to-an-amazon-s3-bucket/) but specifically for the new bucket.

Create an S3 bucket named `cosmetics-<<SPACE>>`.

### Configuration

Start by setting up the following credentials:

* To configure rails to use the production database amongst other things and set the server's encryption key (generate a new value by running `rake secret`):

    cf cups cosmetics-rails-env -p '{
        "RAILS_ENV": "production",
        "SECRET_KEY_BASE": "XXX"
    }'

* To configure AWS (see the S3 section [above](#s3) to get these values):

    cf cups cosmetics-aws-env -p '{
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "XXX",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "XXX",
        "AWS_REGION": "XXX",
        "AWS_S3_BUCKET": "XXX"
    }'

* To configure Sentry

    cf cups cosmetics-sentry-env -p '{
        "SENTRY_DSN": "XXX",
        "SENTRY_CURRENT_ENV": "<<SPACE>>"
        "SENTRY_SECURITY_HEADER_ENDPOINT": "<<URL>>"
    }'

* To enable and add basic auth to the entire application (useful for deployment or non-production environments):

    cf cups cosmetics-auth-env -p '{
        "BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME": "XXX",
        "BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD": "XXX"
    }'

    If the username/password set up in this step are not accepted when trying to visit the page, you may need to [forward the authorization header](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/use_a_custom_domain/#forwarding-headers)

* To enable and add basic auth to the health check endpoint at `/health/all`:

    cf cups cosmetics-health-env -p '{
        "HEALTH_CHECK_USERNAME": "XXX",
        "HEALTH_CHECK_PASSWORD": "XXX"
    }'

* To enable and add basic auth to the sidekiq monitoring UI at `/sidekiq`:

    cf cups cosmetics-sidekiq-env -p '{
        "SIDEKIQ_USERNAME": "XXX",
        "SIDEKIQ_PASSWORD": "XXX"
    }'

Once all the credentials are created, the app can be deployed using:

    SPACE=<<space>> ./cosmetics-web/deploy.sh

### Cloud Foundry reference

#### Useful examples

Please take a look at the GitHub actions in `.github/workflows` to see how deployments are done.

#### Proper executable

If `cf` is not working, try `cf7`

#### Login to CF Api

```
cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk -u some@email.com
```

#### SSH to service and run rails console

```
cf ssh APP-NAME

app/bin/tll bin/rails c
```

#### List apps

```
cf apps
```

#### Show app details

```
cf app APP-NAME
```

#### Show app env

```
cf env APP-NAME
```

#### List services

```
cf apps
```

#### Antivirus API

See [antivirus repo](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-antivirus).

#### Maintenance page

Sometimes, database migrations, infrastructure updates, etc., require making the service inaccessible.
We achieve this by redirecting the web requests to our application to a `maintenance` application that displays a static HTML page.

Cosmetics has a cli tool to set/unset maintenance mode. It can be found at `bin/production-maintenance-mode`.

To set the service under maintenance mode:
```
./bin/production-maintenance-mode on
```
To remove the service from maintenance mode:
```
./bin/production-maintenance-mode off
```

See [maintenance in infrastructure repo](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/beis-opss-infrastructure/blob/master/maintenance/README.md).

#### Other infrastructure
