    h1.govuk-heading-l Product safety database about page and guidance
    p
      | The Product safety database is used by Trading Standards and other market surveillance authorities (MSAs) to
        report, track and share product safety information. It replaces the European Union’s RAPEX and ICSMS systems.

    h2.govuk-heading-m When to use the service
    p
      | In line with the the General Product Safety Regulations, registered users from Trading Standards and MSAs can
        use the service to:
    ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
      li report ‘serious’ product safety risks
      li
        | manage routine product safety issues including passing them on to another organisation, and tracking their
          progress
      li share and find information on products and businesses
      li receive alerts from OPSS about serious product safety issues

    h2.govuk-heading-m Reporting a ‘serious’ product safety risk
    p
      | MSAs must use the service to report ‘serious’ safety product issues in the UK. The OPSS will share the
        information with all other MSAs through the Product safety database.
    p
      ' When reporting a serious issue you must include a risk assessment. To assess the level of risk, refer to an
        established methodology, for example the
      = link_to "EU RAPEX risk assessment guidelines",
          "https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/consumer-safety/rag/#/screen/home"
      |.
    p
      | You should add both serious and routine issues to the Product safety database. If you are unsure if a case is
        serious then add the information about the case and assign it to OPSS. OPSS will then work with you to help
        determine the severity and what to do next.

    h3.govuk-heading-s Deal: MSAs’ responsibilities
    p
      | When an MSA reports a serious issue through the Product safety database, OPSS will add it to RAPEX. If the UK
        leaves Europe with a deal, the UK must continue to report unsafe products to the EU using RAPEX during the
        transition period.

    h3.govuk-heading-s No deal: MSAs’ responsibilities
    p If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the UK will:
    ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
      li no longer need to report product safety information to RAPEX
      li lose access RAPEX data which is not publicly available
    p The Product safety database will send alerts about unsafe products on the UK market to local authorities.
    p

      |.

    h2.govuk-heading-m Accessing the service
    p
      | To access the Product safety database you must be a registered user from a market surveillance authority. This
        includes local authority Trading Standards, the Office for Product Safety and Standards and UK government
        bodies which have market surveillance powers.
    p
      ' Every MSA has an administrator who can invite colleagues to use the service. You can find out who does this for
        your organisation by emailing
      = mail_to "opss.enquiries@beis.gov.uk"

    h2.govuk-heading-m Setting up a colleague as a registered user
    p
      ' If you are the administrator for your organisation, you can invite colleagues from
      = link_to "the team page", your_teams_path
      |.
    p
      | Administrators should only invite people from their organisation whose responsibilities include reporting,
        tracking or sharing information on product safety.

    h2.govuk-heading-m Case confidentiality
    p Most information is visible and searchable to all registered users. This includes information about:
    ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
      li products
      li businesses
      li open and closed cases including their progress or outcome
    p Information is restricted when needed, for example, if legal action is being taken.

    h2.govuk-heading-m Staying in line with GDPR
    p
      | When you create a case you should not add any personal information about members of the public. If you add
        correspondence from a member of the public that includes their personal information you must mark the uploaded
        files as ‘consumer contact details’. The service will prompt you to do this. This restricts visibility so that
        people from outside your organisation cannot see them.
