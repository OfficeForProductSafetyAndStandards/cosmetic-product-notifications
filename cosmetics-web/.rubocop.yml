# Reasoning behind disabling this rule after orginally trying to apply fixes in
# the codebase to pass Rubocop check with the rule enabled:
# - Makes testing harder as you cannot setup partially initialized objects for
#   unit testing a particular behaviour on the object, forcing to do a full object
#   initialization.
# - Also makes harder to do testing over an object not being #valid?, as will
#   raise an exception before we can assert over the object validation errors.
# - Found multiple instances when the validity of the resulting object after
#   creation/saving was being checked afterwards, but Rubocop wasn't able to
#   identify it. I would end having to manually disable/enable the rule in multiple
#   places.
# - With the "!" methods enforcing validations in every call, I see a good chance
#   to introduce bugs in the current codebase in situations where an object is
#   being built with multiple steps, being invalid until some stage. This would
#   now raise a runtime exception.
