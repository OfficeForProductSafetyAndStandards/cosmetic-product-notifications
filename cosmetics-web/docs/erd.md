## Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)

A diagram of the apps's models is automatically generated by [rails-erd](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd)
during every deployment.

Select the [most recent ERD workflow run](https://github.com/OfficeForProductSafetyAndStandards/cosmetic-product-notifications/actions/workflows/erd.yml) and download the "ERD" build artifact
from the bottom of the Summary page.

ERDs are used by analysts and others in OPSS.
