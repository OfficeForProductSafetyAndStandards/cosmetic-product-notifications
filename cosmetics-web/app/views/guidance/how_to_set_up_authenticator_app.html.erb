      This guidance describes how to set up an authenticator app on your device as a form of
      twoâ€‘factor authentication (2FA) and why this is important.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Download your authenticator app</h2>

    <p>
      You can download an authenticator app on any smart device, such as a smart phone or tablet.
      Examples of authenticator apps are the
      <%= link_to "Google Authenticator", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en", target: :_blank %>
      and
      <%= link_to "Microsoft Authenticator", "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator", target: :_blank %>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Use your authenticator app to register on the service</h2>

    <p>
      Once your authenticator app is installed on your device, you will then need to open it
      and scan the QR code or manually enter the supplied code.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your authenticator app will then be set up for the service. A six-digit passcode will appear
      in the authenticator app, this passcode can then be entered on the service.
      You will now be able to use your authenticator app to login to your account.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Advantages of an authenticator app for 2FA</h2>

    <p>
      2FA provides a way to ensure that you are the person you claim to be when accessing services,
      it prevents unauthorised people from accessing your account.
      This second method of authentication is done through something which only you will have access to.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whilst 2FA passcodes can be received by text, the main advantage of using an authenticator app
      for 2FA is that you do not need a mobile phone signal to receive passcodes.
      Authenticator apps are also more secure, as passcodes sent by text are at higher risk of being intercepted.
