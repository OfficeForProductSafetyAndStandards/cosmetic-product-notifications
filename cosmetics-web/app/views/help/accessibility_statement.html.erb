      OPSS is committed to making its websites accessible, in accordance with the Public
      Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations
      2018.
    </p>

      The Submit cosmetic product notifications service is partially compliant with the
      <%= link_to "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1", "https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/" %>
      AA standard, due to the noncompliances and exemptions listed below.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h2>

    <p>
      The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h2>

    <p>
      Some information and relationships are not programmatically determined. This fails
      WCAG 2.1 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships).
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour contrast ratio of some content is insufficient. This fails WCAG 2.1 1.4.3
      (Contrast (Minimum)).
    </p>
    <p>
      Information and functionality are lost if some content is magnified. This fails WCAG
      2.1 1.4.10 (Reflow).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some headings and labels are insufficiently descriptive. This fails WCAG 2.1 2.4.6
      (Headings and Labels).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some content requiring user input lacks appropriate labels or instructions. This fails
      WCAG 2.1 3.3.2 (Labels or Instructions).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some elements are not nested appropriately. This fails WCAG 2.1 4.1.1 (Parsing).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some content does not have an accessible name to help users identify its purpose
      and reference it. This fails WCAG 2.1 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value).
    </p>
    <p>
      We plan to fix all these issues by June 2021.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>

    <p>
      Content that is not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
      From 1 January 2021, the Submit cosmetic product notifications service requires a
      ‘Responsible Person’ – a manufacturer, importer, distributor or appointed company or
      person – to register cosmetic products before they are placed on the market in Great
      Britain. Cosmetic products available to consumers in Great Britain on 31 December
      2020 must also be notified under transitional arrangements. The Submit cosmetic
      product notifications service allows Responsible Persons to upload documents they
      have produced. This third-party content is neither funded nor developed by OPSS
      and is not under its control. As such it is exempt under section 4(2)(e) of the
      accessibility regulations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we are doing to improve accessibility</h2>

    <p>
      We will encourage businesses to ensure that the documents they upload to the
      Submit cosmetic product notifications service are accessible.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested the Submit cosmetic product notifications service</h2>
