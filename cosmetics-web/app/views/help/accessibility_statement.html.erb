    <p class="govuk-body">
      From 1 January 2021, the Submit cosmetic product notifications service requires a ‘Responsible Person’ – a manufacturer, importer, distributor or appointed company or person – to register cosmetic products before they are placed on the market in Great Britain. Cosmetic products available to consumers in Great Britain on 31 December 2020 must also be notified under transitional arrangements. The Submit cosmetic product notifications service allows Responsible Persons to upload documents they have produced. This third-party content is neither funded nor developed by <abbr>OPSS</abbr> and is not under its control. As such it is exempt under section 4(2)(e) of the accessibility regulations.
    </p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We will encourage businesses to ensure that the documents they upload to the Submit cosmetic product notifications service are accessible.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We are working with content and design specialists to improve our layout, content and flow to resolve accessibility issues.

      We have rebuilt the ingredient upload facility to remove inaccessible <abbr>PDF</abbr>s using the <abbr>GDS</abbr> style guide to ensure this new piece of functionality is accessible to all users.
