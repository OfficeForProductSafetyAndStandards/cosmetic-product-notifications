      | To notify OPSS about your products, you can either:
    ul.govuk-list.govuk-list--bullet
      li
        |  upload this ZIP file
      li
        |  give the information manually

    p
      | Uploading the ZIP file means you need to answer fewer questions – you can upload up to 100 ZIP files at a time.
