    <p>
      For all new ingredients which are used as colourants, UV-filters, or preservatives, so not listed in Annex 4, 5 or 6, a safety dossier must be submitted to OPSS for safety assessment.
      This also applies to nanomaterials.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is technical guidance on what needs to be submitted in a safety dossier for nanomaterials and what needs to be submitted in a safety dossier for all other ingredients.
      There is also a checklist detailing the information required for a safety dossier. Further information can be found
