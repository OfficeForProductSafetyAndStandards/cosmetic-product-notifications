          Some cosmetics ingredients can cause cancers, promote genetic mutations, or damage the reproductive process when used in large quantities, or in certain
          types of products. These are called carcinogens, mutagens, and reproductive toxins, respectively, and are collectively known as "<abbr>CMRs</abbr>".

        <p class="govuk-body">
          All cosmetic products should be safe for consumers to use, and to this end, they need to be specifically assessed for chemical safety by a qualified
          risk assessor.

          In addition to this, any cosmetic ingredient used in a product that is classified as a category 1A or 1B <abbr>CMR</abbr>, under the Classification, Labelling and
          Packaging of substances and mixtures Regulations (<abbr>GB CLP</abbr>) needs to be notified to <abbr>OPSS</abbr>.
